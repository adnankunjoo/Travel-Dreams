      <p>
        I love discovering new cultures, landscapes and flavors — travel is how I learn about the world.
        Exploring unfamiliar places gives me fresh perspectives and inspires creativity.
        I travel to collect memories, try unforgettable food, and meet people whose stories expand my own.
